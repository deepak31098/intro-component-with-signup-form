#  Intro component with sign up form 

This project is part of solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1). 

The main motivation behind this project is to create design as proximate to given design.

The challenge involve--
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*


The following has to be incorporated to complete this project--
- HTML structuring
- CSS Styling
- Selection of elements in DOM
- DOM manipulation
- Responsive design and media query
- HTML forms
- Client side form validation
